# Useful Terminal/PowerShell Commands

Depending on your operating system, open either terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows). There are some similarities and some differences between Terminal and PowerShell commands. One important one is the usage of slashes (/) in case of Mac, and backslashes (\) in case of Windows, when specifying a path.
